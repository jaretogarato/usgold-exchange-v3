<p>
  <strong>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</strong>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  We may collect and store information about you in connection with your use
  of the Service, including any information you transmit to or through the
  Service. We use that information to provide the Service’s functionality,
  fulfill your requests, improve the Service’s quality, engage in research
  and analysis relating to the Service, personalize your experience, track
  usage of the Service, provide feedback to third party businesses that are
  listed on the Service, display relevant advertising, market the Service,
  provide customer support, message you, back up our systems, allow for
  disaster recovery, enhance the security of the Service, and comply with
  legal obligations. Even when we do not retain such information, it still
  must be transmitted to our servers initially and stored long enough to
  process.
</p>
<p>
  Please also note:
</p>
<p>
  a. <strong>Account Information:</strong> If you create a US GOLD account,
  we may store and use the information you provide during that process, such
  as your full name, email address, zip code, physical address, and other
  information you may provide with your account, such as your gender, phone
  number, and birth date. We may publicly display your first name and last
  initial, as well as any photo or other content you submit through the
  registration process, as part of your account profile. You can modify some
  of the information associated with your account through your account
  settings. If you believe that someone has created an unauthorized account
  depicting you or your likeness, you can request its removal by flagging it.
</p>
<p>
  b. <strong>Contacts:</strong> You may invite others to become a user of
  products and or services offered within US GOLD by providing us with their
  contact information, or by allowing us to access your contacts from your
  computer, mobile device, or third-party sites to select which individuals
  you want to invite. If you allow us to access your contacts, we may
  transmit that information to our servers long enough to process your
  invitations.
</p>
<p>
  c. <strong>Communications:</strong> When you sign up for an account or use
  certain features, you are opting to receive messages from other businesses,
  and US GOLD. You can manage some of your messaging preferences through your
  account settings but note that you cannot opt out of receiving certain
  administrative, transactional, or legal messages from US GOLD. For example,
  if you elect to redeem your USG Token(s) for the direct representation gold
  currency coin or coins – a 1oz Gold American Eagle coin, the shipping
  company i.e. United Parcel Service – Parcel Pro, may provide to you through
  US GOLD a quote for the shipping charges from US GOLD to your physical
  address, and or from an additional business through the Service, we may
  send you messages about your transaction using the contact information you
  provide, including through automated SMS text messages to your phone
  number. We may also track your actions in response to the messages you
  receive from us or through the Service, such as whether you deleted,
  opened, or forwarded such messages. If you exchange messages with others
  through the Service, we may store them in order to process and deliver
  them, allow you to manage them, and we may review and disclose them in
  connection with investigations related to use of the Service, as well as
  our efforts to improve the Service. We may not deliver messages that we
  believe are objectionable, such as spam messages, fraudulent solicitations,
  or requests to exchange reviews for compensation. If you send or receive
  messages through the Service via SMS text message, we may log phone
  numbers, phone carriers, and the date and time that the messages were
  processed. Carriers may charge recipients for texts that they receive. We
  may also store information that you provide through communications to us,
  including from phone calls, letters, emails and other electronic messages,
  or in person. Our phone calls with you may be monitored and recorded for
  quality purposes.
</p>
<p>
  d. <strong>Transactions:</strong> If you initiate a transaction through the
  Service, such as a purchase or redemption, we may collect and store
  information about you, such as your name, phone number, address, email, and
  payment information (such as a credit card number and expiration date), as
  well as any other information you provide to us, in order to process your
  transaction, send communications about them to you, and populate forms for
  future transactions. This information may be shared with third parties, and
  third parties may share such information with us, for the same purposes.
  When you submit credit card numbers, we encrypt that information using
  industry standard technology. If you write reviews about businesses with
  which you transact through the Service, we may publicly display the fact
  that you transacted with those businesses. For example, if you make a
  dinner reservation through the Service and write a review about your
  experience, we may publicly display the fact that you made your dinner
  reservation through the Service.
</p>
<p>
  e. <strong>Activity:</strong> We may store information about your use of
  the Service, such as your search activity, the pages you view, the date and
  time of your visit, businesses you call using our mobile applications, and
  reservations and purchases you make through the Service. We also may store
  information that your computer or mobile device may provide to us in
  connection with your use of the Service, such as your browser type, type of
  computer or mobile device, browser language, IP address, WiFi information
  such as SSID, mobile carrier, phone number, unique device identifier,
  advertising identifier, location (including geolocation, beacon based
  location, and GPS location), and requested and referring URLs. We may also
  receive and store your location whenever our mobile applications are
  running, including when running in the background, if you enable our mobile
  apps to access such information in the course of using the Service. You may
  be able to limit or disallow our use of certain location data through your
  device or browser settings, for example by adjusting the "Location
  Services" settings for our applications in iOS privacy settings.
</p>
<p>
  f. <strong>Different Devices:</strong> You may access the Service through
  different devices (e.g., your mobile phone or desktop computer) and
  different platforms (e.g., the US GOLD website or US GOLD mobile app). The
  information that we collect and store through those different uses may be
  cross-referenced and combined, and your contributions through one US GOLD
  platform will typically be similarly visible and accessible through all
  other US GOLD platforms.

<p>
  <strong>2. COOKIES</strong>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  We, and third parties with whom we partner, may use cookies, web beacons,
  tags, scripts, local shared objects such as HTML5 and Flash (sometimes
  called "flash cookies"), advertising identifiers (including mobile
  identifiers such as Apple’s IDFA or Google’s Advertising ID) and similar
  technology (<strong>"Cookies"</strong>) in connection with your use of the
  US GOLD Service, third party websites, and mobile applications. Cookies may
  have unique identifiers, and reside, among other places, on your computer
  or mobile device, in emails we send to you, and on our web pages. Cookies
  may transmit information about you and your use of the Service, such as
  your browser type, search preferences, IP address, data relating to
  advertisements that have been displayed to you or that you have clicked on,
  and the date and time of your use. Cookies may be persistent or stored only
  during an individual session.
</p>
<p>
  The purposes for which we use Cookies in the Service include:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Purpose Explanation</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Processes Intended to make the Service work in the way you expect. For
  example, we use a Cookie that tells us whether you have already signed up
  for an account.
</p>
<p>
  Authentication, Security, and Compliance
</p>
<p>
  Intended to prevent fraud, protect your data from unauthorized parties, and
  comply with legal requirements. For example, we use Cookies to determine if
  you are logged in.
</p>
<p>
  Preferences Intended to remember information about how you prefer the
  Service to behave and look. For example, we use a Cookie that tells us
  whether you have declined to allow us to send push notifications to your
  phone.
</p>
<p>
  Notifications Intended to allow or prevent notices of information or
  options that we think could improve your use of the Service. For example,
  we use a Cookie that stops us from showing you the signup notification if
  you have already seen it.
</p>
<p>
  Analytics Intended to help us understand how visitors use the Service. For
  example, we use a Cookie that tells us how our search suggestions correlate
  to your interactions with the search page.
</p>
<p>
  You can set some Cookie preferences through your device or browser
  settings, but doing so may affect the functionality of the Service. The
  method for disabling Cookies may vary by device and browser, but can
  usually be found in your device or browser preferences or security
  settings. For example, iOS and Android devices each have settings which are
  designed to limit forms of ad tracking. For flash cookies, you can manage
  your privacy settings by clicking here. Please note that changing any of
  these settings does not prevent the display of certain advertisements to
  you.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>3. THIRD PARTIES</strong>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  Third parties may receive information about you as follows:
</p>
<p>
  a. <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may rely on third party providers
  to support or provide some of the services that are available through the
  Service, such as reservations and food delivery. We may also rely on third
  party providers to perform certain services for us in connection with your
  use of the Service, such as communications and hosting services, network
  security, technical and customer support, tracking and reporting functions,
  quality assurance testing, payment processing, our own marketing of the
  Service, and other functions. We may share information from or about you
  with these third-party providers so that they can perform their services or
  complete your requests. These third-party providers may share information
  with us that they obtain from or about you in connection with providing
  their services or completing your requests. Third party providers may also
  share this information with their subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other
  companies under common control. Some of our web pages utilize framing
  techniques to serve content to you from our third-party providers, while
  preserving the look and feel of the Service. In such cases, please note
  that the information you provide is being provided to the third party.
</p>
<p>
  b. <strong>Aggregate or Anonymous Information:</strong> We may share user
  information in the aggregate with third parties. For example, we may also
  disclose anonymized information about your use on US GOLD, for example if
  you engage in a transaction in connection with US GOLD, we may publicly
  disclose information about the transaction without providing identifying
  information about you or otherwise disclosing your participation in the
  transaction.
</p>
<p>
  c. <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may share information from or
  about you with our parent companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other
  companies under common control, in which case we will require them to honor
  this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires US GOLD, or all or
  substantially all of our assets, that company will possess the same
  information, and will assume the rights and obligations with respect to
  that information as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
  d. <strong>Investigations and Legal Disclosures:</strong> We may
  investigate and disclose information from or about you if we have a good
  faith belief that such investigation or disclosure: (a) is reasonably
  necessary to comply with legal process and law enforcement instructions and
  orders, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, judicial proceeding,
  or other legal process or law enforcement requests served on us; (b) is
  helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in
  connection with any US GOLD product(s) and or service(s); or (c) protects
  our rights, reputation, property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the
  public, such as disclosures in connection with the US GOLD Consumer Alerts
  program.
</p>
<p>
  e. <strong>Links:</strong> The Service may link to third party services,
  like a governmental agency or a business’s URL. Except as set forth herein,
  we do not share your personal information with them, and are not
  responsible for their privacy practices. We suggest you read the privacy
  policies on or applicable to all such third-party services.
</p>
<p>
  f. <strong>Third Party Accounts:</strong> If you sign up for, or log into,
  Yelp using a third-party service like Facebook or Google, or link your Yelp
  account to your account with a third-party service like Facebook or
  Twitter, we may receive information about you from such third-party
  service. If you post content to a third-party service through the Service,
  that third party service will also receive that content, which will be
  visible to anyone that has access to it through that third-party service.
</p>
<p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>4. CONTROLLING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  Other users may be able to identify you, or associate you with your
  account, if you include personal information in any content you post
  publicly at your sole discretion – which US GOLD has no control of and no
  liability for your actions. Please also note that the messages you send to
  or receive from USGOLD are only private to the extent that both you and US
  GOLD will keep them private. For example, if you send a message to US GOLD
  – you may choose later to publicly post it. Also, we may access and
  disclose such messages in the course of investigations relating to the
  purchase and or any use of any product and service provided by US GOLD.
</p>
<p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>5. DATA RETENTION AND ACCOUNT TERMINATION</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  You can close your account by clicking here. We may retain information
  about you for the purposes authorized under this Privacy Policy unless
  prohibited by law. For example, we may retain information to prevent,
  investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
  or to comply with legal obligations. Please note that businesses cannot
  remove their business listings, ratings, or reviews by closing their
  accounts.
</p>
<p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>6. CHILDREN</strong>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  The Service is intended for general audiences and is not directed to
  children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
  children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with
  personal information without parental consent, please contact us here. If
  we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal
  information without parental consent, we take steps to remove such
  information and terminate the child's account.
</p>
<p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>7. SECURITY</strong>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  We use various safeguards to protect the personal information submitted to
  us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of
  transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of
  electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use
  commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we
  cannot guarantee its absolute security.
