      <AccordionItemBody>
        <OpenP textAlign="left">
          We may collect and store information about you in connection with your use of the Service, including any information you transmit to or through the Service. We use that information to provide the Service’s functionality, fulfill your requests, improve the Service’s quality, engage in research and analysis relating to the Service, personalize your experience, track usage of the Service, provide feedback to third party businesses that are listed on the Service, display relevant advertising, market the Service, provide customer support, message you, back up our systems, allow for disaster recovery, enhance the security of the Service, and comply with legal obligations. Even when we do not retain such information, it still must be transmitted to our servers initially and stored long enough to process. 
        </OpenP>
        <OpenP textAlign="left">
          Please also note:
        </OpenP>
        <OpenP textAlign="left">
          a. <strong>Account Information:</strong> If you create a US GOLD account, we may store and use the information you provide during that process, such as your full name, email address, zip code, physical address, and other information you may provide with your account, such as your gender, phone number, and birth date. We may publicly display your first name and last initial, as well as any photo or other content you submit through the registration process, as part of your account profile. You can modify some of the information associated with your account through your account settings. If you believe that someone has created an unauthorized account depicting you or your likeness, you can request its removal by flagging it.
        </OpenP>
        <OpenP textAlign="left">
          b. <strong>Contacts:</strong> You may invite others to become a user of products and or services offered within US GOLD by providing us with their contact information, or by allowing us to access your contacts from your computer, mobile device, or third-party sites to select which individuals you want to invite. If you allow us to access your contacts, we may transmit that information to our servers long enough to process your invitations.
        </OpenP>
        <OpenP textAlign="left">
          c. <strong>Communications:</strong> a.	When you sign up for an account or use certain features, you are opting to receive messages from other businesses, and US GOLD. You can manage some of your messaging preferences through your account settings but note that you cannot opt out of receiving certain administrative, transactional, or legal messages from US GOLD. For example, if you elect to redeem your USG Token(s) for the direct representation gold currency coin or coins – a 1oz Gold American Eagle coin, the shipping company i.e. United Parcel Service – Parcel Pro, may provide to you through US GOLD a quote for the shipping charges from US GOLD to your physical address, and or from an additional business through the Service, we may send you messages about your transaction using the contact information you provide, including through automated SMS text messages to your phone number. We may also track your actions in response to the messages you receive from us or through the Service, such as whether you deleted, opened, or forwarded such messages. If you exchange messages with others through the Service, we may store them in order to process and deliver them, allow you to manage them, and we may review and disclose them in connection with investigations related to use of the Service, as well as our efforts to improve the Service. We may not deliver messages that we believe are objectionable, such as spam messages, fraudulent solicitations, or requests to exchange reviews for compensation. If you send or receive messages through the Service via SMS text message, we may log phone numbers, phone carriers, and the date and time that the messages were processed. Carriers may charge recipients for texts that they receive. We may also store information that you provide through communications to us, including from phone calls, letters, emails and other electronic messages, or in person. Our phone calls with you may be monitored and recorded for quality purposes.

        <OpenP textAlign="left">
          d. <strong>Transactions:</strong> a.	If you initiate a transaction through the Service, such as a purchase or redemption, we may collect and store information about you, such as your name, phone number, address, email, and payment information (such as a credit card number and expiration date), as well as any other information you provide to us, in order to process your transaction, send communications about them to you, and populate forms for future transactions. This information may be shared with third parties, and third parties may share such information with us, for the same purposes. When you submit credit card numbers, we encrypt that information using industry standard technology. If you write reviews about businesses with which you transact through the Service, we may publicly display the fact that you transacted with those businesses. For example, if you make a dinner reservation through the Service and write a review about your experience, we may publicly display the fact that you made your dinner reservation through the Service.

          Third parties may receive information about you as follows:
        </OpenP>
        <OpenP textAlign='left'>
          a. <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may rely on third party providers
          to support or provide some of the services that are available through the
          Service. We may also rely on third
          party providers to perform certain services for us in connection with your

          security, technical and customer support, tracking and reporting functions,

          with these third-party providers so that they can perform their services or
          complete your requests. These third-party providers may share information
          with us that they obtain from or about you in connection with providing
          their services or completing your requests. Third party providers may also
          share this information with their subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other
          companies under common control. Some of our web pages utilize framing
          techniques to serve content to you from our third-party providers, while

          b. <strong>Aggregate or Anonymous Information:</strong> We may share user
          information in the aggregate with third parties. For example, we may also
          disclose anonymized information about your use on US GOLD, for example if
          you engage in a transaction in connection with US GOLD, we may publicly

          companies under common control, in which case we will require them to honor
          this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires US GOLD, or all or
          substantially all of our assets, that company will possess the same
          information, and will assume the rights and obligations with respect to
          that information as described in this Privacy Policy.

          necessary to comply with legal process and law enforcement instructions and
          orders, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, judicial proceeding,
          or other legal process or law enforcement requests served on us; (b) is
          helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in
          connection with any US GOLD product(s) and or service(s); or (c) protects
          our rights, reputation, property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the
